# Pathfinding-Findings
Experimenting with the A* path-finding technique

### astar.py
This contains the first implementation of A* path-finding, it includes a visualer to see how the algorithm iterates through the grid and determines the shortest path.  
Tested with both Euclidean and Manhattan distance


### astar_add_diag_remove_euclidean.py
This is built onto the astar.py file.  
Added: 
- Ability for the path to move diagonally through open areas.
- Algorithm now handles different distances between two Spots
